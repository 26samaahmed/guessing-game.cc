# Guessing Game
Let's write a guessing game where the player must guess a secret number between 1 and 100. Since we don't know how to generate random numbers and working with random numbers are unpredictable, we will always have the same secret number.

The goal of this exercise is to master the use of loops.

Your main function shall have an almost infinite loop. The only way to exit out of the almost infinite loop is if the player wins and then chooses to exit the game by refusing to play again.
